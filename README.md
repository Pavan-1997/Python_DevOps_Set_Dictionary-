# Sets             
    
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### Creating a Set:
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Adding and Removing Elements:
```python
my_set.add(6)  # Adding an element
my_set.remove(3)  # Removing an element
```

#### Set Operations:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

union_set = set1.union(set2)  # Union of sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # Intersection of sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)  # Difference of sets
```

#### Subset and Superset:
```python
is_subset = set1.issubset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a subset of set2
is_superset = set1.issuperset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a superset of set2
```

### Practice Exercises and Examples

#### Example: Managing a Dictionary of Server Configurations and Optimizing Retrieval

##### Scenario:
Suppose you are managing server configurations using a dictionary.

```python
server_config = {
    'server1': {'ip': '192.168.1.1', 'port': 8080, 'status': 'active'},
    'server2': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': 8000, 'status': 'inactive'},
    'server3': {'ip': '192.168.1.3', 'port': 9000, 'status': 'active'}
}
```

##### Function for Retrieval:
```python
def get_server_status(server_name):
    return server_config.get(server_name, {}).get('status', 'Server not found')
```
##### Example Usage:
```python
server_name = 'server2'
status = get_server_status(server_name)
print(f"{server_name} status: {status}")
```

# Dictionary:

A dictionary in Python is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values using keys. It is also known as a hashmap or associative array in other programming languages. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, providing fast access to values based on their keys.

## Creating a Dictionary:
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

## Accessing Values:
```python
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John
```

## Modifying and Adding Elements:
```python
my_dict['age'] = 26  # Modifying a value
my_dict['occupation'] = 'Engineer'  # Adding a new key-value pair
```

## Removing Elements:
```python
del my_dict['city']  # Removing a key-value pair
```

## Checking Key Existence:
```python
if 'age' in my_dict:
    print('Age is present in the dictionary')
```

## Iterating Through Keys and Values:
```python
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

# Lists vs Sets

## Lists

- **Ordered Collection:**
  - Lists are ordered collections of elements. The order in which elements are added is preserved.
  - Elements can be accessed by their index.

  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
  ```

- **Mutable:**
  - Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements after creation.

  ```python
  my_list[1] = 10
  ```

- **Allows Duplicate Elements:**
  - Lists can contain duplicate elements.

  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

- **Use Cases:**
  - Use lists when you need an ordered collection with the ability to modify elements.

## Sets

- **Unordered Collection:**
  - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. The order in which elements are added is not preserved.
  - Elements cannot be accessed by their index.

  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- **Mutable:**
  - Sets are mutable, meaning you can add and remove elements after creation.

  ```python
  my_set.add(6)
  ```

- **No Duplicate Elements:**
  - Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it won't raise an error, but the set won't change.

  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}  # Results in {1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

- **Use Cases:**
  - Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements, and you want to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### Common Operations:

- **Adding Elements:**
  - Lists use `append()` or `insert()` methods.
  - Sets use `add()` method.

- **Removing Elements:**
  - Lists use `remove()`, `pop()`, or `del` statement.
  - Sets use `remove()` or `discard()` methods.

- **Checking Membership:**
  - Lists use the `in` operator.
  - Sets use the `in` operator as well, which is more efficient for sets.

```python
# Lists
if 3 in my_list:
    print("3 is in the list")

# Sets
if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 is in the set")
```

### Choosing Between Lists and Sets

- **Use Lists When:**
  - You need to maintain the order of elements.
  - Duplicate elements are allowed.
  - You need to access elements by index.

- **Use Sets When:**
  - Order doesn't matter.
  - You want to ensure unique elements.
  - You need to perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference.
